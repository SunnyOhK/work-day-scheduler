# A simple daily scheduler to plan your workday!

## Description 
This application is a simple planner designed to schedule hourly time blocks between 8am - 6pm. Starter code was provided for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I have included minor personal touches to give it some life. Within this application, a user can visualize their day with past, present, and future color-code and can input his/her to-do list, save to local storage, overwrite inputs, and clear their day.

## Access

- Upon launching the planner application, you will notice a live date & time ticker based on user location:

- Next, you will see the full daily schedule resting on a resume paper background with hourly time blocks beginning at 8am and ending at 6pm (the 5pm hour):

- Key features:
    - Sharper and more visible text upon hovering over each time block:

    - Floppy disk save icons to set your schedule inputs (with hover):

    - Saved events will remain within the hourly field until the user clears the list:

    - Color-coding to display time periods of past, present, and future based on user's current time of the day.

    - And a "Clear My Schedule" button to wipe the slate clean (complete with hover effects):
